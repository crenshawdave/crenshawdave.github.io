What differentiates ETH 1.0 from ETH 2.0 is the consensus mechanism. Consensus mechanisms ensure that all nodes on the network synchronize with one another and can come to an agreement on transactions. The ETH 1.0 consensus mechanism used is called Proof-of-Work (PoW), while ETH 2.0 uses the Proof-of-Stake (POS).","content-2":"In Proof-of-Work, miners use server processing power to solve mathematical puzzles which in turn is used to verify new transactions on the block. In Proof-of-Stake, instead of the miners trying to solve complex mathematical puzzles, validator nodes are responsible for verifying transactions, but require a significant amount of crypto delegated or \u201clocked\u201d with them. This incentivizes proper behavior while preventing any network manipulation or attacks."},"what-is-eth-staking":{"title":"What is ETH staking?","description":"As explained earlier, ETH 2.0 uses the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Validators who wish to process transactions on Ethereum need to lock up 32 ETH so they can be randomly picked by the protocol at particular intervals to add a new block on the ETH network. Validators will seek the help of stakers to lock up as much ETH as possible with their validator node to improve their odds of selection. Staking is useful for the Ethereum network because of the following reasons.","q1":"The more validators, the better the security for the network","a1":"Proof-of-Stake allows more parties to be involved in the consensus and computing work required to secure blockchain networks. Incentivizing validators and stakers with ETH grows the network and provides resistance against events such as 51% attacks, further increasing security.","q2":"It\'s more sustainable","a2":"To become a validator you don\'t need complex, energy-consuming, and capital-intensive server power.

In return, you as a staker receive your fair share of the rewards earned in the validation process."},"item-2":{"title":"How does staking work?","description":"Staking works by contributing different tokens to validator nodes. Ankr Staking simplifies this process by delegating your tokens automatically to the best validators while issuing you liquid staking tokens in return, such as ankrETH. These tokens not only gain you rewards, but also have liquidity and can be traded on major exchanges."},"item-3":{"title":"What cryptocurrencies can be staked?","description":"You can stake several tokens on Proof-of-Stake blockchains via Ankr Staking, like ETH, MATIC, DOT, FTM, AVAX, and more."},"item-4":{"title":"How do I start staking?","description-1":"You can start staking by navigating to Ankr Staking and connecting your wallet from the supported wallet options.

Additionally, staking through Ankr Staking provides several additional benefits, such as increased flexibility and the opportunity to earn more with Liquid Staking tokens in DeFi. ","link":"Learn more."},"item-6":{"title":"What are the risks of staking?","description":"The only risk for stakers is the chance they will miss out on rewards during any time a validator they staked with is slashed. Slashing is a protocol-level penalty associated with a validator failure if it validates an invalid transaction, attacks the network, or goes offline. However, your staked tokens will not be slashed \u2014 slashing impacts only the self-stake of the validator. Ankr only delegates to trusted and reputable validator nodes to avoid any validator that would act maliciously."},"item-7":{"title":"How much can I earn from staking?","description":"Ankr Staking makes it easy to calculate how much you could be earning on your available assets. You can visit the staking calculator by clicking on the \u201cLearn More\u201d button on every staking option. The staking calculator provides a monthly and yearly estimation of your rewards."},"item-8":{"title":"Do I need to keep my staked coins in a specific wallet?","description":"After staking your tokens, you can transfer them to any wallet that supports them.
